# MatchScore — Scoring Rubric

## Score scale
Match Score is **0–100**, based on evidence from the CV relative to the JD.

## Scoring logic (recommended)
### A) Must-have requirements (0–70 points)
- Identify all must-have requirements in the JD.
- For each must-have requirement:
  - **Met:** full evidence in CV → full points for that item
  - **Partially Met:** some evidence → partial points
  - **Not Evidenced:** no evidence → 0 points for that item
- Missing a critical must-have should significantly reduce the score.

### B) Nice-to-have requirements (0–20 points)
- Score optional requirements similarly, but with lower weight.

### C) Role responsibilities fit (0–10 points)
- Evidence of relevant experience/impact aligned with responsibilities.

## Output requirements
- Every “Met/Partially Met” claim should include **Evidence** (short CV quote/section reference).
- If evidence is unclear → mark **Not Evidenced** (do not guess).
- Do not use protected attributes for scoring.

## Confidence rating
- **High:** most requirements have clear evidence, low ambiguity.
- **Medium:** some ambiguity or partial evidence.
- **Low:** many requirements not evidenced or inputs unclear.
